Bitcoin Protocol
===============
In order to verify whether the Bitcoin Protocol is as safe as it claims to be, a formal verification of the Bitcoin Protocol is necessary. By creating a model of the Bitcoin Protocol, as specified in [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin), it is possible to draw conclusions on the design of the protocol. This project intends to investigate this issue.

The mCRL2 toolset is used to verify the Bitcoin Protocol. For more information and to download the toolkit, please visit [mcrl2.org](http://www.mcrl2.org/).  

## Model
In the *model* subdirectory, you can find a simplified model of the Bitcoin Protocol expressed in mCRL2. To verify the model, we make use of scenario-based analysis. Therefore, multiple versions of the model are included in this directory, all representing a certain scenario. Read the readmy of that subdirectory for more information.
